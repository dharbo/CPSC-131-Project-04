# Flight Network Graph
The aim of this group project is to implement graph traversal algorithms that will tell you where you can fly with at most one layover and 
the shortest routes to those places. For this project, the world's flight network is modeled as an undirected, weighted graph where the edge weight 
is the great-circle distance between the airports.
